# Optimal control for the instability suppression in an electrostatic plasma system via reinforcement learning
## 🧭 Introduction

This repository provides **code and simulation tools** for the **optimal control of an external electric field** to suppress the **bump-on-tail instability** in a **one-dimensional electrostatic plasma system** governed by the **Vlasov–Poisson equations** by using reinforcement learning. We integrate a Particle-In-Cell simulation with optimal control by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with reinforcement learning, and verify the suppression of instabilities using a linear damping rate and Fourier analysis. 

The repository includes:
- A **PIC simulation code** for solving the 1D Vlasov–Poisson system.
- An **optimization framework** for computing the optimal external control field.
- Visualization tools for analyzing distribution functions, electric fields, and system energy evolution.

## 📚 Background

### 1. Electrostatic Plasma and Vlasov–Poisson System

The **Vlasov-Poisson equation** is a differential equation that describes the time-evolving distribution function of a collisionless plasma \cite{swanson2008plasma}. For a one-dimensional electrostatic plasma on a short timescale, we can neglect the magnetic field term and assume the ions are stationary, allowing electron motion to dominate the dynamics. 

```math
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial f_e}{\partial t} + v \cdot \nabla_x f_e - E \cdot \nabla_v f_e = 0 \\
\nabla^2 \phi(x,t) = \int f_edv - 1 \\
E(x,t) = -\nabla \phi(x,t) + E_{ex}(x,t) \\
\end{aligned}
```

Here, $f_e(x,v,t)$ is a distribution function of electrons on a phase space, $E$ and $\phi$ are the electric field and its potential, respectively. The electrons in this systems follow the equation described below.

```math
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &=v \\
\dot{v} &=-E \\
E_{ex} &=\sum_{n}{a_n\sin\frac{2\pi n x}{L} + b_n\cos\frac{2\pi n x}{L}}
\end{aligned}
```

Here, $E_{ex}$ is a parameterized external electric field that serves as a control input to suppress the instability. For numerical simulations, we use Particle-In-Cell method, discretizing the system by $N$ super-particles with a particle-grid mapping.

### 2. Bump-on-Tail Instability

The **Bump-on-tail instability** is a complex kinetic instability induced by the plasma-wave interaction. Suppose the high-energy electrons are injected into the thermalized plasma, which results in a **non-Maxwellian distribution** with a **“bump” (high-energy tail)** in velocity space. The distribution of electrons in a velocity space is then given as below, generating a bump on the tail of the distribution. 

```math
f_0(v)=\frac{1}{(1+a)\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{v^2}{2 v_{th}^2}} + \frac{a}{(1+a)\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(v-v_b)^2}{2 v_{th}^2}}
```

This bump introduces a **positive slope** in the velocity distribution function $\partial f / \partial v > 0$, which enables **wave-particle resonance** and the **growth of Langmuir waves**. This transfers the energy from particles to the wave, results in a growth of the wave perturbation and is oscillated at the nonlinear stage.

### 3. Optimal Control
The **Bump-on-tail instability** itself leads to 

- **Energy transfer** from particles to waves  
- **Phase-space vortex formation**  
- **Flattening** of the velocity distribution (quasilinear diffusion)  

Thus, suppressing this instability is crucial in several applications such as:
- Plasma heating and transport control  
- Space and astrophysical plasmas  
- Controlled fusion devices  

#### Objective Functional

This project formulates an **optimal control problem** to design an **external electric field** that minimizes the energy growth associated with the bump-on-tail instability. We define a cost functional that balances **stabilization performance** and **control effort**:

```math
J:= \text{KL}[f(t=T),f_{0}] + \int_{0}^T \int_0^L|\nabla \phi(x,t)|^2 dxdt + \lambda \int_{0}^T \int_0^L|E_{ex}(x,t)|^2 dxdt
```

where the first term represents the KL-divergence between the final and initial distributions, which should be minimized to maintain the distribution. The second term corresponds to the electric energy generated by the electrons and should be reduced by suppression. Finally, the third term denotes the electric energy of the external fields, which should be minimized to enhance overall efficiency. 

#### Optimization Method

One might be issued to apply the optimal control for this PDE-constrained optimization problem since $f(x,v,t)$ follows high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics which makes it intractable to directly solve this PDE. Among the various methods, we choose DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), which is a continuous-action actor–critic algorithm.

The critic approximates the value function $V$. The actor approximates the optimal feedback control $u^{*}(f)$. This is exactly what the HJB equation encodes: The critic network learns an approximation to the value function, effectively learning a numerical solution to the HJB equation. The actor network implements:

```math
u^{*}(f):=\argmin_u H(f,u)
```

where $H$ is the control Hamiltonian in the HJB equation. Thus, DDPG = approximate dynamic programming = HJB value iteration in continuous control.
